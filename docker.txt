++docker run 

docker run hello-world

when docker runs image it runs a filesystem snapshot
there is a default command that is run after container is made

container > kernel > ram/network/cpu + commands like ls, echo and such( these are programs)


override default command
e.g
docker run busybox echo hi there
docker|run|image|override command


++docker ps
docker ps --all

docker run busybox ping google.com
will run continue to ping google until stopped, measures latency?

container lifecycle
creating and running are two different things
dockerrun = docker create + docker start 

docker start is about "default command"
docker start -a container_ref
-a is attach, so any output coming from container will output it to your 

cant do on a exited container b/c cant replace default command
docker start -a 2318239a echo bye there 

deletes stopped containers and stuff, will prompt y/n
docker system prune 

look at output tht has been emitted by the container
docker logs 

docker stopped
hardware singal - SIGTERM(terminate signal) will give container some time to do things and clean itself
has a default timer of 10sec before it changes to docker kill 
e.g ping command does not respond to sigterm b/c it wants to run forever
docker kill 
SIGKILL - means to shut down right now and dont do any additional work 


multi command containers

oddity with redis 
redis-cli

docker exec -it <container_ref> <command>
docker exec -it asdasd redis-cli

docker exec -it 12323ad sh
^^ use shell program to send comamnds to container(differnet shells=bash,powershell,zsh, sh)
most of the time will just use exec sh to poke around but dont use for default command for things like web servers and such

Dockerfile Flow 
Base image
Commands to install dependecies and additionalprograms
Command to run on container startup
